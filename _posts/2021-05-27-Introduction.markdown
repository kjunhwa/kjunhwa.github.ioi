My name is JUN-HWA KIM.  
I'm a PhD student in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul. 
I am interested in image classification, Video processing, Video recognition, object detection, and Gerative model. 

Also, I like to join the competition such as Kaggle, Dacon. 

I enjoy to share the knowledge and discussion, So please contact any time to my e-mail : jhkim414@naver.com
